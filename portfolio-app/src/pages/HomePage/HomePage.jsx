              I am an aspiring Software Developer, with a background as a Data
              Specialist as well as Customer Service roles. I have always had a
              passion for Computer Science, when I was in high school I built my
              first personal computer! That computer has been through many
              modifications, and is still what I use today. I was inspired to
              start my journey as a Software Engineer when I came across some
              online coding challenges. I was surprised at how much fun I had
              doing them, but never expected to fall in love with it. I have put
              myself through the Software Engineering Immersive course with
              General Assembly, while working full time. This experience was
              definitely challenging but taught me patience and time management
